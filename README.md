# MobieBrawl

A Unity 2D arcade platformer, with assets and code created entirely by yours truly

This was my first Unity project that didn't involve following a set of tutorials

Over the course of this project I learnt how to:
- Create simple player movement, attack, and health scripts
- Create simple enemy AI - the enemy patrols until it sees the player or is attacked and then waddles towards the player
- Use a drawing tablet with Photoshop
- Use sound effects
- Create game music (I used Ableton Live 9 Studio for this)

### Things I'm proud of

- Almost everything in this game was drawn, coded, animated, composed by me
- The game is a complete piece of work - there is a start menu, pause menu, tutorial, game over screen
- I still maintain that the music slaps, even if it is a bit simple.

### Issues

- The jump controls are a bit broken - I think there is an issue in ground detection but haven't looked into it
- Animations are a bit rough
- Camera follows too tightly - this project comes before I learnt about the existence of cinemachine
- Missing game feel - bullets are too small and have no kick, enemies don't actually attack, sound effects are a bit rubbish
